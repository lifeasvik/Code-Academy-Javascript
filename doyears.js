Calculate dog years vs human years

// Creating a variable to set to my age as a reference
let myAge = 10;
// Creating a variable to save the early years of the dog
let earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears *= 10.5;
// Creating variable that subtracts the early years of dogs life
let laterYears = myAge - 2;
// Multiplying the later years of the dogs life to equal 4 years
laterYears *= 4;
console.log(laterYears);
console.log(earlyYears);
// Adding the early years and later years together
let myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
// Creating a variable for my name in lower case
let myName = 'Rupi'.toLowerCase();
// Logging the final results as a string
console.log(`My name is ${myName}. I am ${myAge} years old in human years which is ${myAgeInDogYears} years old in dog years.`);
